NodeJS execution env for multiple platforms and build APIs and also
Comand line applications. Real time applications.

RT typically are done with Websockets

Http: stateless - cacheable
    TCP: transport protocol
    Resources.(html, js, image)
    REST API
    Not event driven

Websockets: statefull - no cacheable.
    TCP: transport protocol
    real time, info 2 way, low latency
    2 way communication
    Event driven



in Http
 user send req
 server reply with a response


 With Http a chat can be implemented using POLLING
    every 5 sec ask for a new message.

With Http Server event exist as well.

issues:
    in http you have to send a lot of info (60 ms aprox)


in Websockets:
    Initial HTTP handshake. define websokets protocol.
    A persistent connection is stablised with Websockets
        this allow 2 way communication.
